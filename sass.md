# Sass

## Filename

Start the filename with an underscore, like any Sass partial. The name of the component should be singular. One exception is "tabs", because "tab" just seems weird. If a component's name is more than one word, separate each word with a hyphen.

```
_button.scss
_media-object.scss
_tabs.scss
```

## File structure

The elements of the component should go in this order:

- Settings variables
- Sass mixins
- CSS output
