# Components

## Naming

- The official name for a component should be singular. This is most important for filenames.
  - Examples: `_panel.scss`, `panel.js`
  - Exceptions: "Forms", "Tabs", "Breadcrumbs"
- Write out components in lowercase, unless it's a title of a page.
  - Named plugins are an exception, like Reveal and Interchange.

## File Contents

- **Need standard for file-level comments.**
