# GitHub

All GitHub repos need a readme (`README.md`), contributing document (`CONTRIBUTING.md`), and a license (`LICENSE`).

## Readme

For frameworks, the readme should be short, and mainly serve as a portal to other resources. The readme will have these sections:

- **Getting Started:** Links to various install methods. Always lead with the quickest install method, which for the frameworks is the CSS version.
- **Documentation:** Link to the documentation, and instructions on how to compile the documentation locally.
- **Contributing:** Link to contributing guide.

For libraries, the readme will contain installation and usage instructions. Larger libraries like Motion UI may have dedicated documentation folders, with pages written in Markdown.

## Issue Templates
